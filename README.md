# Design-and-Development-of-a-Dexterous-Manipulator


### [Project Page](https://rohang9929.github.io/dexterous-manipulator/) | [Demonstration Video](https://youtu.be/8YgNTh4wjoE)

The device created demonstrates the adaptive behavior of compliant, under-actuated grippers and their superior grasping capabilities 
under uncertainties. The device is very light-weight and was fabricated using rapid prototyping equipment and hybrid manufacturing techniques.
